For a better in-depth definition than we could possibly provide, please go here."},{Q:"I've never done Kendo, can I join the club?",A:"Absolutely. The club has a very strong beginner program. No prior experience is necessary. The best time to join is the very first class of the quarter, usually the first Wednesday of the quarter. Please arrive at least fifteen minutes early as we begin at 7pm sharp. The class progresses very quickly and all the early basic instruction is necessary to be successful. We will accept new members during the first two weeks of the quarter. After that, no new beginners will be accepted. Also, if you think you will be lonely as the only beginner, fear not! Depending on which quarter you join in, at least 20 other people will be in the beginner class with you awkwardly learning how to yell at the tops of their lungs too. You can make friends with them if you think the higher-ups are intimidating or something."},{Q:"What should I expect on the first day?",A:"For the first day, you should bring $50 ($15 for club dues, $25 to purchase a wooden sword, $15 to purchase a shinai bag) and show up in comfortable clothes to exercise in.\n      \n\n      If you would like to read up on routine basics before you show up, you can find them Here For the most part, you will be taught basics to prepare you for armored practice, which is like regular practice but with +15 defense. You will learn things like footwork, swinging, and how to yell like a crazed monkey. If you are shy and don't think you can yell a lot, then you are one badass nonconformer."},{Q:"I've done Kendo before, can I join the club?",A:"Anyone with previous Kendo experience is welcome to join the club anytime during the quarter. It is assumed that you know all the basics of Kendo and will fit in with existing class groups. If you're feeling rusty, let us know and you can stay out of bogu until you're comfortable."},{Q:"Do I have to be in good shape?",A:"No. While it certainly does help to be in good physical shape, it certainly isn't necessary. The act of training conditions the body to do the art. All of those senpai sitting at home playing video games all day attributes to this."},{Q:"Does it hurt?",A:"A little. The most common injuries for beginners is a blistered left foot. This injury becomes less and less common as footwork improves.\n      \n\n      The most common injury that intermediate practitioners suffer is a bruised right wrist or hand. In general, the chance of suffering injury as a result of diligently practicing proper Kendo is very low."},{Q:"Does the club participate in tournaments?",A:"Yes. The club participates in several regional tournaments throughout the year. These range from local tournaments, such as the Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation Annual Taikai in November to tournaments in Canada such as the Steveston Taikai in February. The club also hosts the University of Washington Invitational Kendo Taikai every April."},{Q:"Does the club sell all of the necessary equipment?",A:"Yes. We sell shinai, bokken, and uniforms. It is also possible to get armor through the club, though we loan out sets to use. If you wish to purchase armor or other Kendo-related equipment, that can also be done through the club. Just be sure to let us know ahead of time when you want shinais, because our president doesn't lug his gun case around every day."},{Q:"How much does it all cost?",A:'Club dues are $15/quarter. PNKF membership dues are $30/year. AUSKF membership dues are $60/year. Regional federation membership entitles members to participate in tournaments, promotional exams, and seminars. Membership in the PNKF also entitles members to take advantage of the "open door" policy, which allows all PNKF members to practice at other PNKF member dojos free of charge.\n      \n\n      Compared to other martial arts, this is relatively cheap. The major cost is in equipment purchases. However, many of these purchases are one-time only. The first purchase a beginner is required to make is a bokken (solid wooden sword used for swinging/form practice) which costs $25. After a month or so, students must purchase a shinai (split bamboo sword used for striking) which costs $25. Sometime in the first two quarters, it is recommended that students purchase uniforms. A complete set consisting of keikogi (light jacket) and hakama (pleated trousers) starts at $70.\n      \n\n      This may seem expensive at first, but keep in mind that these costs can be distributed over the period of two or three quarters. Easily the most expensive purchase in Kendo is the bogu (armor). A decent set costs anywhere from $500-$1000. However, the club loans out sets to qualified members for free (free is good).\n      \n\n      Keep in mind that much of this equipment will last for several years-- making the overall expense far less than what many different arts charge in monthly dues alone. For a more indepth breakdown of costs, please refer to the Kendo Cost Sheet'},{Q:"I am not a current UW student, can I still practice at UW?",A:"At this time, only students/staff/faculty may practice with the club. The Seattle area boasts a number of excellent dojos, if you are simply interested in learning Kendo and are not affiliated with UW then please see our links page to find out about other local dojos."},{Q:"Is Kendo like the Boffing Club?",A:"While both clubs may have enthusiastic practices, the similarities end there. Kendo may seem at first to be too restrictive on \"swordplay\" and movement, but the rewards come from dedication and patience through the practices over time. The discipline and mindset that evolves from Kendo is representative of the points we emphasize--not spontaneous whacking with bamboo sticks. If there is one thing Kendo isn't, it's instant gratification."},{Q:"Kendo is serious business, will I fit in?",A:"Regular practices are indeed serious and run like any other dojo. Outside of practice, we hang out and have awesome parties and drink awesome bubble tea. Some people just want to do some Kendo and don't go to parties. Others find that Kendo isn't for them but hang out with us anyways because we're awesome like that."},{Q:"Do you have Kendo in the Summer?",A:"Yes. Summer quarter Kendo starts and ends with Summer quarter at UW. Be sure to purchase a summer IMA pass. For those who are borrowing bogu, summer quarter extensions are available."},{Q:"I have more questions. Who can I contact?",A:"For questions/issues regarding the club or this site, please visit one of our practices or visit our Facebook Page."},{Q:"Where is Ted?",A:"We're not really sure, and at this point we're not really sure who Ted is, but check here."}],x=[{abstract:"Wrist Shakes",detail:"Arms to sides, hands below center of gravity, as if shaking water off hands, relax, breath normally."},{abstract:"Knee Lifts",detail:"Lift knee straight to front toward shoulder, alternate sides, exhale.\n      \n\n      Lift heels up in back, kick butt with heels, keep knees down, inhale."},{abstract:"Spinal Flexion and Extension",detail:"Tuck chin to chest, flex the whole spine forward (don't lean forward), cross arms in front, spread shoulder blades apart, exhale.\n      \n\n      Look up at ceiling and down the wall in back of you (don't lean back), spread arms to sides and back, press shoulder blades together, inhale."},{abstract:"Jumping",detail:"In place with feet straight ahead, then forward and back, then side to side"},{abstract:"Up and Over",detail:"Swing arms to front up over head (elbows straight but not stiff), palms front, knees and ankles extend, relax hands and wrists, inhale.\n      \n\n      Swing arms down and back behind (palms back), knees and ankles bend, exhale."},{abstract:"Knee Series",detail:"Heels & toes together, hands on knees, bend knees forward/back, side/side, circle.\n      \n\n      Keep heels on floor, carefully stretch Achilles when bending knees.\n      \n\n      Stretch hamstrings when straightening knees.\n      \n\n      Keep back straight (extended), don 't round (flex) spine.\n      \n\n      Spine more vertical when bending knees, more horizontal when straightening knees.\n      \n\n      Exhale as knees bend, inhale as knees straighten."},{abstract:"Twist",detail:"Feet straight ahead, shoulders width apart\n      \n\n      Rotate hips, shoulders and head left and right, look left and right as far as comfortably possible, don't force the range of motion.\n      \n\n      Front arm slaps opposite shoulder, back of back hand hits opposite butt cheek.\n      \n\n      Inhale as you twist back, exhale as you return to the front."},{abstract:"Jumping",detail:"In place with feet straight ahead, then both forward and back, then both side to side, count every other bounce."},{abstract:"Spinal Side Bend",detail:"Feet straight ahead, shoulders width apart, hands on hips, fingers & thumbs point forward.\n      \n\n      Lean shoulders to one side, push hips to the other, touch ear toward shoulder, exhale, inhale as you come up."},{abstract:"Leg stretches",detail:"Starting by turning to the side\n      \n\n      calf\n      \n\n      achillies\n      \n\n      groin\n      \n\n      hamstring\n      \n\n      other side"},{abstract:"Arm Circles",detail:"Heels shoulders width apart, toes pointing 45 degree to outside.\n      \n\n      Arms to sides, make large circles in both directions, elbows straight, hands relaxed.\n      \n\n      Inhale and exhale on every other circle."},{abstract:"Jougeburi x20",detail:"1/4 Suburi"},{abstract:"Men-uchi x30",detail:"2/4 Suburi"},{abstract:"Sayu-men x20",detail:"3/4 Suburi"},{abstract:"Haya-suburi 5x20",detail:"4/4 Suburi"}],O=[{abstract:"The Concept of Kendo",detail:"The concept of Kendo is to discipline the human character through the application of the principles of the Katana."},{abstract:"The purpose of practicing Kendo",detail:"To mold the mind and body.\n      \n\n      To cultivate a vigorous spirit.\n      \n\n      And through correct and rigid training.\n      \n\n      To strive for improvement in the art of Kendo.\n      \n\n      To hold in esteem human courtesy and honor.\n      \n\n      To associate with others with sincerity.\n      \n\n      To forever pursue the cultivation of oneself.\n      \n\n      To love his country and society.\n      \n\n      To contribute to the development of culture.\n      \n\n      To promote peace and prosperity among all peoples."},{abstract:"Kendo Safety Guidelines",detail:"Alertness, awareness, foresight, clear assessment of the total situation all times, responsibility, and careful preparedness are among the major goals of kendo training and tradition, in one word, SAFETY ... safety for oneself, for others, for the community, and ultimately for the entire human family.

Courteous manners are required by Kendo tradition. All kenshi must show respect to their seniors in the art, especially senior sensei (instructors). Fostering respect and concern for fellow kenshi - helping each other train and develop physically and spiritually - is the purpose for studying kendo, and must motivate every consideration in the dojo.\n      \n\n      2. Shoes must be removed prior to entering the dojo, and neatly arranged so as not to create a hazard, or kept in one"s equipment bag.\n      \n\n      3. Horseplay, fooling around, waving or throwing equipment, lounging, casual conversation during practice, or behaving carelessly in the dojo is strictly forbidden.\n      \n\n      4. Smoking, eating, chewing gum, or drinking of any beverage whatsoever is strictly forbidden inside the dojo. This applies to visitors or guests as well as kenshi.\n      \n\n      5. The dojo floor must be carefully cleaned and inspected for hazards prior to the beginning of every practice and all trash picked up. Sweeping the floor is the duty of all junior kenshi, supervised by the ranking kenshi.\n      \n\n      6. All chairs, tables, benches and other loose furniture must moved well away from the practice area, and all personal baggage neatly arranged against the wall.\n      \n\n      7. It is forbidden to kick, step on, or step over any kendo equipment at any time.'},{abstract:"Preparation",detail:"8. Excellent bodily hygiene and cleanliness is required of every kenshi. Toenails and fingernails must be clean and neatly trimmed, hair clean and combed. Ill or injured kenshi are not allowed to practice without specific permission of the instructor on a case-by-case basis.\n      \n\n      9. No rings, necklaces, earrings, br /acelets or other jewelry are permitted during practice, because they are very dangerous to both wearer and partner. There is also a tradition of stripping away worldly trappings and insignia of status before entering any dojo.\n      \n\n      10. The proper kendo clothing, keikogi (jacket) and hakama (trousers) must be worn correctly at all times during practice, because the design of the hakama creates a large cushioning airspace and the keikogi features special heavy knit, both specifically for absorbing the occasional misdirected blow.\n      \n\n      11. Beginners who have not yet entered the sparring practice are not required to wear keikogi and hakama, and are permitted to wear ordinary loose clothing, subject to review by an instructor, while they are learning.\n      \n\n      12. All keikogi, hakama, and bogu (protective armor) must be kept clean and in good repair. Neatly patched or mended equipment, subject to review by an instructor, is quite acceptable and respected. Kenshi must learn to pack their bogu (complete set of all equipment) properly, and also to pack the bogu of senior sensei.\n      \n\n      13. Kenshi must first obtain permission before using tape, elastic supporters, elbow pads, or other standard athletic supplies."},{abstract:"Practice",detail:'14. The classic kendo body posture is taught for technical reasons basic to the art. Kenshi are urged to bear in mind the important health and safety benefits that result from keeping this posture. br /eathing is deep-, blood circulates freely, all the muscles are relaxed and poised, and the eyes are able to take in all surroundings easily. Constantly remaining in this classic stance makes it easy to accurately hit the desired target and minimizes or eliminates entirely "wild shots&quot which sting or br /uise one"s partner in inappropriate places. It also prevents twisting straining, or pulling one"s body painfully. Most injuries are immediate feedback letting you know that you are not doing what you were taught. The same may be said of ordinary everyday life. All kendo is based on the hypothesis that there is a "Force&quot (ki) which every individual can learn to tap. Without the proper posture, the "Force&quot can never flow freely or be fully available.\n      \n\n      15. In particular, the special foot positions and footwork movements have very serious health and safety ramifications and must be learned thoroughly as the very first stage of kendo training. It is extremely important that both feet be pointed straight ahead at all times. The untrained tendency to turn or twist the left foot out must be altered consciously, as serious damage to the Achilles tendon may result from this action due to the heavy pressure advanced kendo movements br /ing to bear upon the left tendon. The orthodox kendo footwork also prevents blisters cracks, tears, and other minor foot injuries. The toes must slide or skim across the floor in the manner prescribed. This allows the kenshi to "feel&quot the terrain while keeping eye contact with the partner. It also keeps the toes from snagging on the skirt of the hakama, which may result in falling down, pulling a leg muscle, br /eaking toes, ankles, or other bones, etc. In other words, correct posture and correct footwork are absolutely essential to the safe as well as beautiful performance of kendo. Kendo can never be mastered without them, and it is dangerous to depart from them.\n      \n\n      16. Consistent attendance is essential to development in kendo. It also an important factor in safety. Absenteeism without adequate reason cannot be tolerated. Prolonged absence can only jeopardize the thinking other kenshi thus causing a weak dojo both physically and spiritually. You must notify the instructor or assistant instructor prior to any absences.\n      \n\n      17. All kenshi must take part in the regular warmup and stretching routine which begins every class or event. Late comers are required to bow in properly and go through the warmup routine on their own before they join the group practice. These warmups follow a careful plan and are not optional.\n      \n\n      18. When kenshi visit other clubs or attend tournaments they assume full responsibility for warming up and stretching properly, using the routine learned at our practice if necessary.\n      \n\n      19. The shinai (bamboo sword) must be carefully and thoroughly maintained by the kenshi on a continuous basis, and every shinai must be inspected for cracks, splinters, tom or br /oken leather fittings, or other damage, at the beginning of practice. Only perfect shinai may be used actual practice.\n      \n\n      20. During practice all kenshi must be vigilant about any damage which may occur to the shinai. Stop immediately to repair or replace any substandard shinai.\n      \n\n      21. During practice all kenshi must alertly listen for the command "YAME&quot (stop), and instantly stop whatever they"re doing and look at instructor as soon as they hear it.\n      \n\n      22. For intermediate and advanced kenshi the correct wearing of bogu is required. Every kenshi must watch alertly to make sure his or own bogu and that of fellow kenshi has not become untied, tangled or br /oken, and every kenshi has the responsibility to tell others of equipment problem.\n      \n\n      23. The design of the men (face guard) provides excellent protection for the eyes, but it is still possible for particles or splinters to enter the grillwork. Therefore kenshi are encouraged to consider the option of obtaining shatterproof plastic eyeglasses or a special plastic shield which snaps inside the grill for added defense of the eyes.\n      \n\n      24. During practice every kenshi must try hard not to injure fellow kenshi in any way, and must stop immediately if injury does occur. Abusive kendo is prohibited.\n      \n\n      25. Actions taken in anger are never permitted. However, because the symbolic combative mode of kendo, sometimes people accidentally become temporarily angry. We are willing to bear risking a remote possibility of anger, because this training helps us learn to remain cool in real life situations. However, the concept is to learn never to lose control. Thus anger must be actively guarded against, and all kenshi must honestly stop if they become angry, or perceive that their partner is angry.'},{abstract:"Summary",detail:"Proper kendo techniques will be carefully taught to every kenshi, but ultimate responsibility for safe and correct conduct of the art of kendo lies with the individual. To study kendo is to accept the challenge taking active responsibility for your own life and for the well-being those around you. If you have any special circumstances which might prohibit you from following any safety guidelines, please inform one of the sensei."}],T={"Affiliated Federations":[{name:"All United States Kendo
